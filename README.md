Lapse Kex ported to 9.00 - Still WIP

Very fast and reliable but can KP :P

Warning: This repository is a work in progress. Do not use it by defaultâ€”or better yet, donâ€™t use it at allâ€”until I and/or someone else declare it stable. There are issues with certain games, such as black screens, problems with save data, and multiple kernel panics. The offsets for PS4 9.00 still need to be verified. If you choose to use it, do so at your own risk.
Key Features:

ðŸŽ¯ Firmware Support: PS4 9.00 (95% stability rate)

âš¡ Fast Execution: Optimized exploit chain with performance tweaks

ðŸ”— Kernel Access: Integrated Lapse kernel exploit for full system access

ðŸ“± Web-based: Runs directly in the PS4 browser - no additional tools required

ðŸ’¾ Offline Cache: Built-in caching system for reliable offline usage


TODO:

* Fix game issues. Black screen. Saves. No boot

PR are welcome



* Exploits

  * PSFree: src/psfree.mjs

  * Lapse (kernel): src/scripts/lapse.mjs
